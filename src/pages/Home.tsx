            While I've done my best to make things functional, there are likely
            many things that don't work as expected. I know some of you space
            cowboys like to break things and would appreciate it if you kept the
            damage to a minimum.

            With that out of the way, take a look around or read some of the
            recent posts listed below.

        <section className="pt-12">
